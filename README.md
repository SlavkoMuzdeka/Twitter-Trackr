## Getting started

### Key Dependencies & Platforms

### Running Locally

#### Installing Dependencies

- [Python 3.11](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python) - Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform.

- [Virtual Environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) - I recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organized.

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by running:

```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages I selected within the `requirements.txt` file.
